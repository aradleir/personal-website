                Fonts are essential tools for designers, shaping the visual identity of their creations. Here are five fonts that every designer should know:<br><br>

                <b>Helvetica:</b> Known for its clean and timeless design, Helvetica is a versatile sans-serif font that works well in various contexts. Its neutrality makes it suitable for both print and digital designs, making it a staple choice for designers seeking simplicity and readability.<br><br>

                <b>Times New Roman:</b> A classic serif font, Times New Roman exudes elegance and sophistication. Widely used in traditional print media, it adds a touch of professionalism to documents and publications, making it a go-to choice for formal designs.<br><br>

                <b>Arial:</b> Another popular sans-serif font, Arial is similar to Helvetica but slightly more rounded. Its widespread availability and easy legibility across different screen sizes make it a preferred choice for digital designs, particularly in web and interface design.<br><br>

                <b>Futura:</b> This geometric sans-serif font embodies a modern and minimalist aesthetic. Its clean lines and distinct geometric shapes make it perfect for contemporary designs, logos, and headings, allowing designers to create a sleek and futuristic look.<br><br>

                <b>Garamond:</b> A classic serif font with a rich history, Garamond exudes elegance and sophistication. Its balanced proportions and graceful curves make it a popular choice for body text in printed materials, providing a touch of timeless beauty to editorial designs.<br><br>

                By familiarizing themselves with these fonts, designers can expand their typographic repertoire and have a foundation for creating visually appealing and well-crafted designs that effectively communicate their intended messages.
